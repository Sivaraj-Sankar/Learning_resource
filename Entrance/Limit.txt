1) sin(1/x) --> x --> 0 , it will oscillate b/w -1 to 1 --> will not stay in the single value --> So it's leads to undefined limit 
2) sin(theta) --> opposite/hypotenuse
3) sin(theta) represents the y-coordinate of the points 
4) sin(theta + 2npi) --> for any integer n = sin(theta)
5) The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x) and  its integral is âˆ’cos(x) + C (a constant)


Continuous Function Example 
1) Constant Function
2) Power Function 
3) Polynomial Function
4) Quotients of Polynomial namely rational functions
5) Circular Functions of sin (x) and cos (x) every point in their domain 
6) tan x, cot x, cosec x, sec x are continuous on their proper domains in view of
the reciprocal and quotient rules in the algebra of limits.
7) nth root functions
8) Reciprocal function is not defined at 0 hence it is not continuous 
9) Greatest Integer function is not continuous at x = 0. It is Discontinuous at each integer point 
10)Modulus Function is continuous at all points of the Real Number R
11)Exponential Function is continuous at all points 
12)Log Function is continuous at all x > 0 (0,infinity)

Algebra of continuous functions
1) f + g is continuous at x = x0
2) f - g is continuous at x = x0
3) f.g is continuous at x = x0
4) f/g is continuous at x = x0 (g(x) not equal to 0)
5) Composite function theorem on continuity 
    If f is continuous at g(x0) and g is continuous at x0 then fog is continuous at x0

Closed Interval Continuous Function
1) A function is said to be continuous on the closed interval [a,b] if it is continuous on the open interval (a,b) and 
1) If the function f is continuous from the right at a and continuous from the left at b and it continuous at each point x0 belongs to (a,b)
